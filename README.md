# *NaNo DeepSeek*:
  *This repo contains nano version of DeepSeek LLM's that implemented from scartch. For now only Deepseek-v3's implementation is avilable. so You're thinking like what you mean NaNo, so it just captures underlying details without scaling to B-parameters.Am trying to make sure all the important features of Deepseek-v3 are implemented in way easy to go through.*
