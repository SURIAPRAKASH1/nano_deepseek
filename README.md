# _NaNo DeepSeek_:

_This repo contains nano version of DeepSeek LLM's that are implemented from scartch. For now only Deepseek-v3's implementation is available. so now You're thinking like what you mean NaNo. So it just captures underlying Algorithms (more precisely self learning Alg ðŸ§ ) details that are introduced (or updated MHA -> MLA with some extra stuff) without scaling to B-parameters.Am trying to make sure all the important features of Deepseek-v3 are implemented in way easy to go through._
